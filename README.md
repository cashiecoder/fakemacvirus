# fakemacvirus
This app is a fake virus written in Applescript that when opened adds itself to the list of login items and then shuts the computer down. When booted up again, the computer opens the app and it shuts down again.
IMPORTANT! To allow the computer to boot up again, boot in Safe mode. It will prevent login items from opening. If you are on an Intel mac, hold down shift while booting up. If you are on a mac with an Apple Silicon processor, hold the power button until you see "Loading startup options...". Select the disk to boot from and click "Continue in Safe Mode". Once in Safe Mode, you can then remove the app from the login items in System Settings or System Preferences. 
Thank you!
